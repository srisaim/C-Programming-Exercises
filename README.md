# CS240 Simple C Projects
Programming in C:

CS240 Programming in C is an advanced programming course for people who already have experience with a high-level programming language, such as Java. This course explores the C programming language, emphasizing its application both as a machine-level language and as a general-purpose language. Key topics include number representation, masking, bitwise operations, and memory allocation. Additionally, the course covers more general programming concepts like dynamic data structures, file I/O, separate compilation, program development tools, and debugging techniques.


# What I Learned
Understand C Programming Language:
  - Developing a deep understanding of the syntax, semantics, and idioms of the C programming language.

Low-Level Programming Concepts:
  - Learning and applying concepts such as number representation, masking, and bitwise operations which are crucial for system-level programming.

Memory Management:
  - Understanding and effectively manage memory in C, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

Data Structures in C:
  - Implementing and using dynamic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.

File Handling and I/O Operations:
  - Gaining proficiency in performing file operations and input/output handling in C.

Development Tools and Debugging:
  - Learning to use various C development tools and debugging techniques to write efficient and error-free code.


# Course Structure and Content

Introduction to C:
  - Overview of C language basics.
  - Transitioning from high-level languages to C.

Machine-Level Programming:
  - In-depth understanding of number representation, masking, and bitwise operations.
  - Exploration of low-level programming concepts.

Memory Management:
  - Detailed study of memory allocation, pointers, and pointer arithmetic.
  - Techniques for effective memory management in C.

Dynamic Data Structures:
  - Implementation of various data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs in C.

File I/O and Separate Compilation:
  - Methods for file handling and performing input/output operations.
  - Understanding the process of separate compilation in C.

Advanced Topics:
  - Utilization of development tools specific to C programming.
  - Advanced debugging techniques to troubleshoot and optimize C programs.

Overall Perspective:
CS 240 is a beginner-intermediate course that requires a solid foundation in basic programming concepts. Luckily, I was interested in deepening my understanding of C programming, particularly its application in systems and low-level programming, so I found it not too difficult. However, I was encouraged to actively participate in hands-on projects and assignments for a practical understanding of the course material, which strengthened my C concepts.
