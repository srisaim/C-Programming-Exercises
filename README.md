# CS240 Simple C Projects
Programming in C:

CS240 Programming in C is an advanced programming course tailored for individuals who already have experience with a high-level programming language, such as Java. This course explores the C programming language, emphasizing its application both as a machine-level language and as a general-purpose language. Key topics include number representation, masking, bitwise operations, and memory allocation. Additionally, the course covers more general programming concepts like dynamic data structures, file I/O, separate compilation, program development tools, and debugging techniques.


# What I Exercised
Understand C Programming Language:
  - Develop a deep understanding of the syntax, semantics, and idioms of the C programming language.

Low-Level Programming Concepts:
  - Learn and apply concepts such as number representation, masking, and bitwise operations which are crucial for system-level programming.

Memory Management:
  - Understand and effectively manage memory in C, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

Data Structures in C:
  - Implement and utilize dynamic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.

File Handling and I/O Operations:
  - Gain proficiency in performing file operations and input/output handling in C.

Development Tools and Debugging:
  - Learn to use various C development tools and debugging techniques to write efficient and error-free code.
